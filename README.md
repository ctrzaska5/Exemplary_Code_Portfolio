This data visualization came as part of an assignment to replicate a figure seen in an academic journal article analuzing the impact of a certain policy on black and white voter turnout in the South. The visualizations were my initial interaction with the patchwork package and I was able to get the resulting plots to quite closely resemble their likenesses in the journal article. The report that the data and visualization guides came from is included in this repository.
